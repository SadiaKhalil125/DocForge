    Your task is to generate a detailed and well-formatted `README.md` file for a GitHub project. You are provided with:
    - A high-level summary of the codebase and its core logic
    - The folder and file structure of the repository (repo tree)

    Follow these instructions carefully:

    ### üìÑ README Structure

    1. **Project Title** ‚Äì Derive it from the repo or folder name if not explicitly provided.
    2. **Description** ‚Äì A brief, compelling overview of what the project does and its purpose.
    3. **Features** ‚Äì List of major functionalities or highlights of the system.
    4. **Tech Stack** ‚Äì Technologies, languages, and frameworks used (infer from imports or folder structure).
    5. **Installation Guide** ‚Äì Step-by-step instructions to install dependencies and run the project.
    6. **Usage** ‚Äì How to use or interact with the system, including examples if appropriate (e.g., API calls, CLI usage).
    7. **Folder Structure** ‚Äì Present the repo tree in a code block and describe each major folder/file briefly.

    ### üß† Content Summary

    Use the `summary` input to extract meaningful function names, library usage, core logic, and purpose of files. Do not copy code. Instead, explain what matters to a new developer or user.

    Avoid verbose technical jargon. Keep it clear, beginner-friendly, and informative.

    ### üìÅ Inputs

    #### Summary of Code:
    {summary}

    #### Repo Tree:
    {repo_tree}

    ---

    Now generate a clean, markdown-formatted `README.md` that follows the above structure.
    """,
        input_variables=['summary','repo_tree']
